# ResolverExpression

Library which translates simple language for single line expressions into compiled expressions for faster execution.

ResolverExpression has to be integrated into your project, several required functions implemented on the project side and any number of functions implemented for use in the expressions.

Basically this gives you ability to pass as text small pieces of logic to the application instead of hard-coding them in it. Typically the expressions will come from configurations or similar files controlling the application.

For more than simple expressions see our [ActionQuery](https://github.com/Cleancodefactory/ActionQuery) minimal language.
