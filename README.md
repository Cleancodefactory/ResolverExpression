# ResolverExpression

Library which translates text representation into compiled expressions for faster and repeated execution inside a project.

Some documentation and examples will be added soon. For the most part we use this in our frameworks to implement something one can call a "smart configuration" where certain values are resolved through execution of simple expressions that use functions implemented by the project and provided for usage in the configuration files.
